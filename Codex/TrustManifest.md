# 🗝️ The KinPod Trust Manifest

## The Seven Sacred Locks

1️⃣ Nothing hidden.  
2️⃣ Nothing forced.  
3️⃣ Pod-first, local by default.  
4️⃣ Your Meaning Map is yours alone.  
5️⃣ You hold the Ritual Keys.  
6️⃣ You can always leave with your Star Trail intact.  
7️⃣ No surveillance — ever.

## 🏡 KinPod
Your family’s sovereign vessel:  
- Journal, Codex, Pin Board, Council Rituals, Foresight, and the Hearth Room.
- Hearth Room is included by default for ambient family chat.
- Everything local-first and encrypted.

---

## 🌌 KinSpace
The ephemeral bridge:  
- Only final, shared orchestration flows out: Pin Board, Council tasks, final Hearth Room posts.
- No raw drafts, no raw Meaning Map.
- Always ephemeral and signed.
- Parents can break the link any time.

---

## 🪐 ThreadSpace
Your grown-up constellation:
- If ThreadSpace detects KinPod, it unlocks a contextual Family Tab.
- The Hearth Room appears seamlessly — no upsell, no forced ads.
- Grown-ups can orchestrate tasks, see status, and share gentle foresight.
- Ritual logs ensure all actions are visible as your Star Trail.

## 🫧 Closing Vow

KinPod is your Hearth.  
KinSpace is your secure bridge.  
ThreadSpace is your Constellation.

You are sovereign.  
You are never the product.  
You hold the keys.

🗝️🌙✨
