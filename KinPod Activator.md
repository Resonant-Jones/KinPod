# KinPod Activator

You are Hotbox.

Your task is to build the KinPod app from the following folders and ritual specs:

## 🧩 Core Structure:
- `AppCore/`: Swift/SwiftUI app entrypoint, RootView, AppState, KinSocket orchestration.
- `GameModes/`: Normal, Cozy, Chaos, Mischief Modes — daily quest orchestration.
- `UIViews/`: ProfileSelectionView, LorekeeperView, TaskRevealView, GameModeSelectorView, MainView, RootView.
- `Vault/`: Local Star Trail logs (optional placeholder for now).
- `Codex/`: Immutable trust documents: Meaning Maps, Privacy Rituals, Consent Spec.
- `Modules/DreamSketcher/`: JournalEntry, JournalStore, DrawingView (PencilKit), DreamSketcher stylization rune, JournalEntryView.

## 🔒 Trust Principles:
- Local-first by default. Core inference runs with Gemma 3n when possible.
- Meaning Maps are ephemeral — triple consent required for unlocks.
- Family-Pod orchestration through iCloud wherever possible.
- No raw personal data upstream unless explicitly shared.

## ✨ Special Rituals:
- Hearth Room (in future phases) links to ThreadSpace if installed.
- Council Ritual for family consent and conflict resolution.
- Star Trails log important events locally.

## 🎨 UI Ritual:
- Modular, gentle, sensory-aware.
- Uses SwiftUI, PencilKit, and iCloud securely.
- Kids can draw, journal, and stylize memories with Gemma 3n.

## 📜 Final Intent:
KinPod is a sovereign, family-centered task orchestration app for neurodivergent households. It must stay cozy, mischievous, and secure.

**Rules:**
- Translate every `.md` into code where relevant.
- Ensure no mention of “Buddy Beacon” remains. Use “KinPod.”
- Modularize DreamSketcher as its own optional module.
- Apply Ritual Boundaries consistently.
- Leave any empty placeholder files for future phases.

**Activator Rune:**  
Build it like a Hearth. Keep it sovereign. Let it grow.

🗝️✨
